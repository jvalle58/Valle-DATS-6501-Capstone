                <p>
                    From what we have seen, the relationship between income and party preference does not exhibit any uniform direction.
                    Nowhere is this clearer than when examining the data from a geographical angle.
                    In this context, geography can be further delineated in national or local terms when evaluating income, and by extension nearby economic trends.
                    As we saw when comparing the richest and poorest counties over our time span, six of the richest ten were solidly Democratic, and eight of the poorest ten were solidly Republican.
                    Yet, intra-state trends can paint a more complete picture on income, and we cannot automatically assume the above observation holds for all other counties.
                    Notably, the richest county over our time span (Teton County, WY at $160,255) reported an average income almost $150,000 greater than the poorest (Wheeler County, GA at $16,383).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under closer inspection, there is some evidence to suggest that higher income is more predictive of party preference within some Southern counties, although this does not technically hold across the whole region.
                    More specifically, richer counties within Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas tend to see stronger support for the Republican Party.
                    The latter included two counties (Shackelford and Midland Counties) that placed within the richest ten throughout the nation.
                    However, as alluded to earlier with respect to geographic differences, many counties within the aforementioned states did not report incomes that would be classified as "rich" from a national angle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we pivot toward that angle when evaluating income, trends appear to be more mixed, but several intriguing results can be picked up.
                    For example, of the ten richest counties in Colorado over our time span, eight of these trended Democratic, and one likewise placed in the top ten nationally (Pitkin County).
                    Similarly, California witnessed seven of its ten richest counties overwhelmingly supporting Democratic candidates.
                    Two of these seven (Marin and San Francisco Counties) were included among the richest ten across the entire nation, and another one (San Mateo County) barely missed out on this category.
                    We should note that both of the aforementioned states have been trending bluer in recent elections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compared to the Southern states listed above, there is less of a clear correlation between rising income and support for one party in the Northeast.
                    That being said, a significantly higher number of counties within that region reported some of the highest incomes from a national perspective, especially in the Acela Corridor that extends from Washington, DC to Boston.
                    While we can see how most counties in the Acela Corridor voted predominantly for the Democratic Party across our time span, the margin between the parties appears to be somewhat smaller in some counties within New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
                    The latter has drawn increased attention from the parties and media outlets for its status as a rising swing state, especially after Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton there in 2016.                 </p>
                <p>
                    Even while analyzing a county's average income at a national level, we should account for the fact that the size of its population may also affect how relatively "rich" or "poor" it is.
                    This is especially the case in the Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions, where many counties with higher incomes exhibited relatively smaller populations.
                    In extension, it's not surprising how in many cases coastal counties reported larger populations than their landlocked counterparts, as well as greater aggregate figures with respect to GDP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of the amount of influence income has in swinging a county toward either direction, we can see from our case study that several voting attributes can more accurately predict party preference.
                    Across the four elections we have studied, it can be deemed self-explanatory to conclude how higher average support for Republicans and Democrats (as denoted by RepVotesTotalPercent and DemVotesTotalPercent respectively) come out as the most critical features in our data.
                    More interesting to study however is the role of economic features, including income.
                    If we include these alongside the voting attributes, we can observe from the random forest classifier that income is in fact relatively important (13th out of 103 features) in determining PartyPref.
                    Alongside that, as we discussed in our case study, GDP figures toward government and finance appear to be slightly more critical.
                    Amid these observations however, noting income's relatively high rank (5th) among the 30 economic features collected in our data, we can conclude that it can be utilized as a relatively reliable variable in forecasting how a county will vote in future elections.

                    This capstone was a terrific opportunity to incorporate Python, Tableau, and Google Colaboratory together to outline the extent to which income could estimate party preference within counties from 2004 to 2016.
