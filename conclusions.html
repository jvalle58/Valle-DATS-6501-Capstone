                <p>
                    From what we have seen, the relationship between income and party preference does not exhibit any uniform direction.
                    Nowhere is this clearer than when examining the data from a geographical angle.
                    In this context, geography can be further delineated in national or local terms when evaluating income, and by extension nearby economic trends.
                    As we saw when comparing the richest and poorest counties over our time span, six of the richest ten were solidly Democratic, and eight of the poorest ten were solidly Republican.
                    Yet, intra-state trends can paint a more complete picture on income, and we cannot automatically assume the above observation holds for all other counties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under close inspection, in most of the states there is evidence to suggest that higher income correlates with, but is not causal of, higher Democratic support.
                    This particularly holds in Western states such as California, Oregon, and Washington.
                    When examining all of the counties together, the richest county over our time span (Teton County, WY at $160,255) reported an average income almost $150,000 greater than the poorest (Wheeler County, GA at $16,383).
                    The former was solidly Democratic and the latter solidly Republican.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even while analyzing a county's average income at a national level however, we should account for the fact that the size of its population may affect how relatively "rich" or "poor" it is.
                    This is especially the case in the Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions, where many counties with higher incomes exhibited relatively smaller populations.
                    Unlike the national trend described above, a notable number of states within the former region (based on their counties) saw rising income correlate with greater support for the Republican Party.
                    Taking into account these and other geographic differences, many counties within states that diverged from the aforementioned trend did not report incomes that would be classified as "rich" from a national angle, especially in the South.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of the amount of influence income has in swinging a county toward either direction, we can see from our case study that several voting attributes can more accurately predict party preference.
                    Across the four elections we have studied, higher average support for Republicans and Democrats (as denoted by RepVotesTotalPercent and DemVotesTotalPercent respectively) were the most critical features.
                    The reason behind this may be due to the fact that counties with inordinately large voting margins between the parties tend to be more extreme toward either the left or right. 
                    More interesting to study however is the role of economic features, including income, in swaying the counties' partisan tendencies.
                    If we include these alongside the voting attributes, we can see from the random forest classifier that income is relatively important (20th out of 103 features) in determining PartyPref.
                    Yet as we discussed in our case study, government and manufacturing appear to be more critical.
                    Amid these observations however, noting income's comparatively higher rank (10th) among the 30 economic features, we can conclude that it can be utilized as a relatively reliable variable in forecasting how a county will vote in future elections, provided that we control for other attributes.
                    This especially applies to controls with economic ramifications.

                    This capstone was a terrific opportunity to incorporate Python, Tableau, and Google Colaboratory together to outline the extent to which income could estimate party preference within counties from 2004 to 2016.
