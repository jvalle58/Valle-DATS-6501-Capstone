                <h1>County Income and Party Preference from 2004 to 2016</h1>

                <p>
                    Welcome!
                    You have arrived at a visual presentation that will analyze in depth the extent to which income influenced how counties across the United States voted in presidential elections from 2004 to 2016.
                </p>
                <p>
                    About a month before the 2020 presidential election, a Gallup public opinion poll indicated that almost nine in ten registered voters identified the economy as the most important matter at stake prior to casting their ballots. 
                    However, the relationship between income and political orientation remains unclear. 
                    At the county level, determining whether income is a historically significant predictor for party preference can help deduce how attitudes toward the country’s most significant challenges, especially the economy, evolve as income rises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this study, income will be defined in per-capita, not aggregate, terms. 
                    When studying the two major parties’ platforms, it’s not surprising that many questions surrounding income can emerge. We should note that a voter’s self-evaluation with respect to income may vary depending on whether it is taken from a national or local scale.  
                    Furthermore, while social issues are frequently cited as a factor behind why a county votes the way it does, its economic composition may also play a role on that and its income.  
                    In the period of time between the 2004 and 2016 elections,  a county’s geography and population must also be accounted for. 
                    The extent to which income affects party preference may vary due to these elements as well.  
                    This project will evaluate how much income can predict party preference by focusing exclusively on economic attributes like GDP, industry, and population.
                    A brief discussion of the results can be found under the Case Study tab.

                    Under the first dropdown menu at the top of this page, this website includes a variety of Tableau visualizations for you to view and study.
                    Several have been designed with filters that allow you to play around with the data and examine changes over time.
                    A second dropdown menu also includes several links to access this visual presentation's references, my GitHub repository, and my Tableau Public profile.
